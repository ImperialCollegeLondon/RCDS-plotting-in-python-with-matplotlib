However, they can also be flexible, allowing for a wide range of customisation.

This is a Python dictionary that holds various values that define the behaviour of matplotlib as a whole.

This is not the only way to access many of these values, but it is common.\n","\n","We can provide this function a dictionary contianing one or more key-values pairs to set the values within ```rcParams```. These changed options will take effect until they are changed back or the program ends. A full list of editable values can be found in [the documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/matplotlib_configuration_api.html).
