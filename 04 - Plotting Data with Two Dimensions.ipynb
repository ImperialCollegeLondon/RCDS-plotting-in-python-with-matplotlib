This will create a new figure ans save a reference to it into the ```fig``` variable. Next, we can create a new set of axes using the command ```ax = plt.axes(projection=\"3d\")```. The argument ```projection``` allows us to tells Matplotlib to create a 3D set of axes in the current figure. Note that, in some versions of Matplotlib, you may need to also import ```mplot3d``` from ```mpl_toolkits``` for the 3D proejction to work.\n","\n","In previous examples, the handling of figures and axes was done automatically. Now, how, we need to get some finer control over what's going on, so we need to handle the creation of the figure and axes manually. Saving a reference to the current figure and axes isn't strictly required for what we've done here but, by creating a reference to them in ```fig``` and ```ax```, we open up the possibility to access them again later. This usage pattern for figures and axes is very common in Matplotlib."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"DXsiQtW109ES"},"outputs":[],"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d\n","\n","# Create a new figure\n","fig = plt.figure()\n","#Create a new set of axes in the figure and specify it should have a 3D projection\n","ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"p6ryK-4F87H_"},"source":["## 3D Scatter\n","\n","To create a 3D scatter plot, we first need to get the figures and axes. We can use these references to set the names of the axes. For instance ```ax.set_zlabel(\"z\")``` labels the z-axis \"z\". Note that the command ```plt.zlabel(\"z\")``` wouldn't work here as you might expect. This is because ```zlabel``` isn't a part of the ```pyplot``` module (unlike ```xlabel``` and ```ylabel```). Instead, we can access the ```set_zlabel``` method of the reference to the axes.\n","\n","We can use ```ax.set_xlim(-2, 11)``` to set the range of the x-dimension which will be displayed on the graph to the range between -2 and 11. This is necessary as, without this, the lower boundary of the x dimension would occur at $x=0$. This command and ones like it, can be useful for controlling the limits of the axes in a number of situations.\n","\n","TWith default options, the axes titles of a 3D plot can be outside the bounds of the image. The command ```ax.set_box_aspect(aspect=None, zoom = 0.85)``` zooms out the camera a little to ensure the axes titles are visible. The default value for ```zoom``` is 1.0, with smaller values zooming out and larger values zooming in.\n","\n","We can scatter points on the axes by using the ```scatter3D``` method of the reference to the current axes. The first three arguments describe the x, y and z locations of the points respectively.\n","\n","By setting the optional ```cmap``` argument to ```\"Blues\"``` we chose to use a blue color palette. More information on colour maps can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html). We can then chose to colour the points according their height in the z-axis by setting the optional argument ```c=zdata```. This means points low on the plot will be transparent and points near the top will be dark, opaque and blue. This can help to give some indication to a viewer about the height of the points and thus, help them to interpret the 3D image.\n","\n","This means, however, some points will be nearly invisible. We can make them more visible by giving them a visible outline. We can do this by setting the optional argument ```edgecolors=\"black\"```.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"rNXLIQZr2kkg"},"outputs":[],"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d\n","\n","# Create a new figure\n","fig = plt.figure()\n","#Create a new set of axes in the figure and specify it should have a 3D projection\n","ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')\n","\n","# Define the data for four points\n","xdata = [-1, 10, 5, 1]\n","ydata = [3, 1, 2, 3]\n","zdata = [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.05]\n","\n","# Set the labels for the axes\n","ax.set_xlabel(\"x\")\n","ax.set_ylabel(\"y\")\n","ax.set_zlabel(\"z\")\n","\n","# Set the limits of the x, y and z axes\n","ax.set_xlim(-2, 11) # x ranges from -2 to 11\n","ax.set_ylim(0, 4) # y ranges from 0 to 4\n","ax.set_zlim(-0.05, 0.25) # z ranges from -0.05 to 0.25\n","\n","# Without this command, some of the axis labels would be cut off.

Matplotlib offers a few options for this. In this example, we'll look at the contour plot.

This is achieved using the command ```ax.contour3D```.\n","\n","The data is provided on a Cartesian grid. The first two arguments give the x and y coordinates of this grid.

So, for a 5x5 grid (like in the example below) this might a list of containing 5 lists, each containing 5 values. Each of the inner lists represents the values along a particular line of constant y. This sequence of sequences should be provided as the third argument to ```ax.contour3D```.\n","\n","The next argument is an integer which specifies the number of contour lines to be included.
