    "# Saving Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Displaying plots is great when you're developing a code and want to preview the results. However, at some point, you'll probably want to use these figures in publications, posters or your thesis. Thus, being able to save your figures to a file to use elsewhere is vital.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved using the ```plt.savefig``` command ([manual page](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.savefig.html)) if you're plotting without explicitly creating a figure and axes. The first argument for this should be a file name (including a path if appropriate). The format of the file to be saved is determined by the extension of the specified filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, if you're running Python on your own computer, such as in Anaconda, the file paths are relative to the location of the Notebook or Python script. If you're using Colab, it will be saved in the file system of the virtual computer Colab is running on. You can access the file system by clicking on the folder icon in the left tab."

    "## Saving Multiple Figures\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code might produce lots of different figures. We can create multiple different figures and sets of axes an save them individually using different filenames. The easiest way to do this is use the ```plt.subplots``` command. Even if you're creating a figure with a single plot, not providing a number of rows or columns will create a figure with a single plot. The second value returned will be reference to a single sets of axes and is commonly saved into ```ax```, ```ax1```, or ```ax2```, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the flexibility of this approach, this approach of creating a figure with a single subfigure is a common and useful way to produce figures of any sort as it creates the a reference to the figure and axes, allowing many figures to be created and manipulated independently."
