This can allow the addition of different types of plots (e.g. a mix of 2D and 3D axes).\n","\n","Firstly, we can create a figure using the ```plt.figure``` command. Initially, there are no axes present. We can then add subplots to this figure using the ```fig.add_subplot``` command ([manual page](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html)). There are a couple of ways we can specify the location of the subplot. The most common is to specify three arguments. The first is the number of rows of subplots, the second is the number of columns of subplots. The third is the number of the subplot, counting from left to right, then top to bottom (beginning at 1). So, to insert a subplot at the top-right of a grid of suplots with three rows and two columns we would use the arguments ```3,2,2```. To insert a subplot at the bottom left of the same grid, we would use ```3,2,5```.\n","\n","The ```fig.add_subplot``` command allows a few details of the plot to be defined, including the projection type using the optional argument ```projection```."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"2AmDNCRuwKWm"},"outputs":[],"source":["import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d # This import is required for the 3D projection to work properly with the add_subplots command\n","\n","# Create an empty collection of subplots\n","fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))\n","\n","# Create a 2D subplot on the left\n","ax_1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 1)\n","ax_1.set_title(\"2D\")\n","\n","# Add a 3D subplot on the right\n","ax_2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 2, projection='3d')\n","ax_2.set_title(\"3D\")"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4H8O6wqg-Eou"},"source":["## Exercise: Programming Experience\n","\n","A survey of postgraduate students has been carried out at Imperial.
