    "Sometimes it can be useful to create a figure with no subplots and add them one by one. This can allow the addition of different types of plots (e.g. a mix of 2D and 3D axes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we can create a figure using the ```plt.figure``` command. Initially, there are no axes present. We can then add subplots to this figure using the ```fig.add_subplot``` command ([manual page](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html)). There are a couple of ways we can specify the location of the subplot. The most common is to specify three arguments. The first is the number of rows of subplots, the second is the number of columns of subplots. The third is the number of the subplot, counting from left to right, then top to bottom (beginning at 1). So, to insert a subplot at the top-right of a grid of suplots with three rows and two columns we would use the arguments ```3,2,2```. To insert a subplot at the bottom left of the same grid, we would use ```3,2,5```.\n",
